<h1 align="center">Kava Compiler Plugin</h1>

The plugin does currently only a few things:
- Adds Kavas dependencies to your JVM - compilations ( only multiplatform projects supported yet )
- Configures Kavas Annotation Processor as well as the generated source directories for it

It also enables support for context receivers, which is required to use Kava.

See [Demo](/demo/).
